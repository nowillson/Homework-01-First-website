	<h1>Pic<em>Me<em></h1>
	<h2>PicMe is a marketplace pairing spectators at sporting events and their photographs with individual participants.</h2>
	<img src="image.jpg" alt="ski marathon">
	<p>Professional photographers are present at sporting events, but they are not well distributed and their photographs are expensive. The chances of having a good action photo taken are relatively slim. PicMe transforms the hundreds, even thousands, of spectators into event photographers. They can snap an action photo, tag the subject with their unique participant number and upload to the app. The participant is then able to download the tagged photographs from the app for a fee.</p>
	<h3>Why PicMe?</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Low-cost, high-quality personalized photographs</li>
		<li>More photos, greater variety and better action shots</li>
		<li>Get paid to take event photos</li>
	</ol>
